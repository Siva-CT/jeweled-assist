Build a complete "Jewelry Assistant" System (Hybrid B2B/B2C).

## 1. INTELLIGENT WHATSAPP BOT (Server-Side)
- **Menu System**: Options for Buy (Gold/Silver/Platinum), Exchange, Sales Support, Location.
- **Advanced Metal Detection**: Automatically detect "Gold", "Silver", "Platinum" in user text.
- **Karat Logic**: For Gold, explicitly ask user for Purity (22K vs 24K).
- **Price Engine**:
  - Live Rates via Python (yfinance).
  - Safety Fallback: Use manual/cached rates if API fails.
  - Formula: (Weight * Rate * 1.15 Making) * 1.03 GST.
- **Threshold Automation**:
  - Estimates < ₹20,000: Auto-reply with price.
  - Estimates > ₹20,000: Add to Pending Queue + Alert Owner.
- **Owner Admin Commands (via WhatsApp)**:
  - `Approve <Amount>`: Approve last request.
  - `Reply <Message>`: Message customer as bot/owner.
  - `Set Threshold <Val>`: Change approval limit.
  - `Set Gold <Val>`: Set manual gold rate.
  - `Status`: View system stats.
  - `Help`: List commands.

## 2. OWNER DASHBOARD (Client-Side)
- **Tech**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS.
- **Features**:
  - **Tinder-style Approval Queue**: List of pending high-value estimates.
  - **Live Chat Area**:
    - Real-time history.
    - **Bot Toggle**: Switch between "Bot Active" (Green) and "Manual Mode" (Red).
    - **Approve UI**: Button to send formatted approval message.
  - **Nudge Button**: One-click "Gentle Reminder" for customers who haven't visited after 24h.
  - **Settings Page**:
    - Configure Store Location (Map Link).
    - Set Admin WhatsApp Number (Instant Switch).
    - Set Manual Rates & Thresholds.

## 3. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT
- **Monorepo**: `/client` and `/server` folders.
- **Robustness**:
  - Twilio/Python errors must NOT crash the server (Catch & Log).
  - Dynamic Environment Variables for all secrets.
  - Express v5 Routing compatible.
